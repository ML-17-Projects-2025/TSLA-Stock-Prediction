# Final Report

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning trading agent capable of predicting Tesla's stock price movements and making buy, sell, or hold decisions to maximize profits over a 5-day trading window (March 24-28, 2025).

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Tesla stock data was fetched from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Feature Engineering**: We engineered technical indicators such as SMA and RSI.
3. **Modeling**: We trained a Logistic Regression model to predict price movements.
4. **Backtesting**: The strategy was backtested on historical data to evaluate performance.
